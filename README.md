# Floyd

<b>Floyd</b> is a multipurpose Discord bot focused on the security and fun of the official RANDARTZ server. Floyd encourages interaction between users with its wide variety of commands it offers, as well as entertaining the user with fun and interesting commands.

The name and image of the bot is based on the original character created by <b>Randy Lynch</b>.

<h2>Background</h2>

FloydBot source code was originally based on RickyBot, a Discord bot that ran on the NeoZones server from 2019 until its shutdown in 2020, and at the same time is based on ROBORANDY5000, the first version of the code, which was intended to be a replacement for [OwlBot](https://github.com/NeoZones/OwlBot_Legacy).

The source code of the bot has been kept private since its creation for personal, political and sentimental reasons. In June 2021, the bot was revamped as FloydBot and its source code was published on Github, a little bit of hypocrisy after what was previously declared by myself.

At the middle of 2021, Discord implemented Slash Commands, a more accessible way of interacting with bots; FloydBot instead used "f?" to access their commands, something that was very old-fashioned at the time, since many bots used slash commands for their functions. Since November 2022, the bot will be rewritten and adapted to this new system, in order to make its development and use much more easy and compact.
